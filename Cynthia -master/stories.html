            <p><font size="4">1-to-1 was able to go deeper and find more stories
              about the homeless. We were also able to gather some stats. Among
              the Berkeley population, there are 50% with no education, 73%
              drug or alcohol use, 36% mental health problems, and 85% are local.

              <p><h4><font size="4" color="#747474">Michael, Shattuck Avenue</font></h4></p>
              <p>Originally from Chicago, Illinois, he left his family and
                crossed the United States by bus to find a job. More than 2,000
                miles away from his homeland, he used to work in restaurants,
                cleaning dishes. Sometimes he would work as a waiter. But after
                having four or five jobs, he decided to quit. He ended up living
                on the street. Three months have passed. He’s still left with no
                money. </p>
                <p><h4><font size="4" color="#747474">Godwin, Dwight Way Shelter</font></h4></p>
                <p>Godwin works in several shelters in Berkeley including the
                  Dwight Way Shelter & the  Harrison House. He obtained his
                  green card in 1999. Since then, he’s always been working in
                  the social field. It has been 21 years now. Godwin had hard
                  times when he was younger. He had to flee his own country
                  because of the civil war. It helped him a lot to help other
                  people, to listen to them and make them happier. It kept him
                  busy and prevented him from reflecting on his own traumas.
                  Godwin told us about a homeless man he used to know before
                  facing health issues. Now he’s in a wheelchair and can’t stand
                  anymore. It makes him sad to see how bad people's lives can
                  become. He also mentioned that recently, a Mexican family
                  arrived in Harrison House with two children. To him, children
                  are just innocent people that don’t deserve to face those
                  situations.
