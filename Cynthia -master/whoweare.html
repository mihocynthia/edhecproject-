              <p>Originally from France, Pauline is spending her last year of
                studies abroad, in UC Berkeley’s Has Business School. “Every
                time I walk by homeless people in the street, the same thing
                happens: I feel very sorry for them but I keep my eyes off, I
                want to help them but at the same time I feel useless, I want to
                stop and talk but instead I just carry on… I was tired of just
                feeling sorry. When I arrived in the Bay Area last August, I was
                shocked by the number of people living on the street. I decided
                to stop being a spectator and act. As one of my teachers told me
                once: When we want something, most of the time we can achieve
                it”</p>

                <p>Gabrielle is also a student from UCB Haas Business School.
                  She is enrolled in the same program as Pauline and they met
                  each other during their first year of Business School, in
                  EDHEC, France. “What struck me when I arrived in the Bay was
                  the tremendous and very visible inequality among people in the
                  street. Where I lived in France, many homeless are also
                  wandering in the streets, but here in the Bay, I felt that
                  poverty what so endemic that I felt nothing could help it, and
                  that on an individual level, nothing could be possible to
                  improve their lives. When we had the chance to create a
                  project with 42 students, it was clear I wanted to do
                  something for these people.” </p>
