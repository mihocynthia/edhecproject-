              identity. At 1-to-1, we connect companies with volunteers who want
              to help homeless people. We are driven by a single goal: to do our
              part in making the world a better place for all. We strive to build
              productive relationships and make a positive impact on the world.

              <p>Originally from France, Pauline is spending her last year of
                studies abroad, in UC Berkeley’s Haas Business School. “Every
                time I walk by homeless people in the street, the same thing
                happens: I feel very sorry for them but I keep my eyes off, I
                want to help them but at the same time I feel useless, I want
                to stop and talk but instead I just carry on… I was tired of
                just feeling sorry. When I arrived in the Bay Area last August,
                I was shocked by the number of people living on the street. I
                decided to stop being a spectator and act. As one of my teachers
                told me once: When we want something, most of the time we can
                achieve it”</p>

                <p>Gabrielle is also a student at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of
                  Business. She is enrolled in the same program as Pauline and
                  they met each other during their first year in EDHEC Business
                  School (France). “What struck me when I arrived in the Bay was
                  the tremendous and very visible inequality among people in the
                  street. Where I lived in France, many homeless people are also
                  wandering but here, in the Bay, I first thought poverty was so
                  endemic that nothing could help it, and that on an individual
                  level nothing could be done to improve their lives. When we
                  had the chance to create a project with 42 students, it was
                  clear I wanted to do something for these people.”

                    want our non-profit association to succeed in helping more
                    homeless people.”
